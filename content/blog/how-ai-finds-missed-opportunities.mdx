# How AI Finds Missed VA Disability Opportunities

Most legal AI tools stop at document classification. They'll tell you which pages are medical records and which are service records. Useful, but not transformative.

CaseScribe goes further. Here's how our AI finds the opportunities that manual review misses.

## The Opportunity Gap

In our experience processing thousands of veterans' cases, we've found that **the most impactful opportunities are also the most commonly missed:**

- **Secondary conditions** that connect to existing service-connected disabilities
- **Rating increases** supported by evidence buried deep in medical records
- **3.156(c) reopening opportunities** when new service records contain previously unavailable evidence

These aren't edge cases. They're opportunities that exist in a significant percentage of cases — but they require connecting evidence across hundreds or thousands of pages. That's where AI has a decisive advantage over human review.

## How CaseScribe Finds Opportunities

### 1. Complete Evidence Mapping

Before looking for opportunities, CaseScribe builds a complete picture of the case. Every document is:

- OCR'd and text-extracted
- Classified into 150+ document types
- Analyzed for conditions, dates, providers, and diagnoses
- Indexed into a searchable, cross-referenced case file

This isn't just organizing — it's understanding. The AI knows what evidence exists, where it is, and what it says.

### 2. Secondary Condition Detection

CaseScribe maintains a knowledge base of condition relationships. When it identifies a service-connected condition, it automatically checks whether the medical evidence supports related secondary conditions.

For example: A veteran service-connected for a knee injury. CaseScribe scans the medical records and identifies documentation of chronic pain, sleep disturbance, and depression — all potentially secondary to the knee condition — with specific medical evidence cited for each.

### 3. Rating Increase Analysis

CaseScribe compares the current rating criteria against the medical evidence in the file. When evidence supports a higher rating, it flags the opportunity with:

- The specific evidence supporting the increase
- The rating criteria that may be met
- The document and page where the evidence appears

### 4. 3.156(c) Service Record Analysis

One of CaseScribe's most powerful features: comparing old and new service records to identify conditions that may qualify for reconsideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

This regulation allows the VA to reconsider a claim when relevant official service records are obtained that existed but weren't in the claims file when the VA previously decided the claim. The result can be earlier effective dates and significant retroactive benefits.

CaseScribe automates this comparison, identifying which conditions are now supported by the newly associated records.

## Why AI Succeeds Where Manual Review Struggles

The math is simple: a 1,000-page C-file reviewed in 4 hours means 4.2 pages per minute. At that speed, a reviewer is scanning, not analyzing. Critical connections between page 47 and page 893 are almost impossible to catch.

CaseScribe processes the same file in under 10 minutes and cross-references every data point against every other data point. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't skip pages. It doesn't forget what it read 5,000 pages ago.

## The Human-AI Partnership

CaseScribe doesn't replace attorneys or claim representatives. It gives them a starting point that would take hours to achieve manually — then lets them apply their legal expertise to the opportunities that matter most.

The AI finds the opportunities. The human makes the decisions.
