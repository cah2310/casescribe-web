# What 100,000 BVA Decisions Tell Us About Claim Success

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) issues thousands of decisions each year. Each one is a data point that tells us something about what works in VA disability claims — and what doesn't.

We analyzed over 100,000 BVA decisions to find patterns that can help representatives build stronger cases. Here's what the data reveals.

## Key Findings

### 1. Evidence Quality Matters More Than Volume

The most common thread in granted appeals isn't the volume of evidence — it's the quality. Cases with strong, specific medical opinions that directly address the nexus between service and disability have significantly higher grant rates than cases with extensive but unfocused medical records.

**What this means for your practice:** Focus on obtaining targeted medical opinions that directly address the specific nexus question, rather than submitting every medical record available.

### 2. Buddy Statements Make a Measurable Difference

BVA decisions that cite buddy statements (lay evidence from friends, family, or fellow service members) in support of the veteran show a notable correlation with favorable outcomes, particularly for conditions where direct medical evidence of in-service occurrence is limited.

**What this means for your practice:** Don't underestimate lay evidence. Well-crafted buddy statements that address specific symptoms, timeline, and impact can strengthen cases significantly.

### 3. C&P Exam Quality Varies Widely

A substantial number of remanded decisions cite inadequate C&P examinations as the reason for remand. Common issues include:

- Examiner didn't review the claims file
- Opinion lacked adequate rationale
- Examiner didn't address all claimed conditions
- Examination didn't include required testing

**What this means for your practice:** Review C&P exam reports carefully. Inadequate exams are grounds for remand and a new examination — but only if you catch the deficiency.

### 4. The Most Common Conditions at the BVA

The conditions that appear most frequently in BVA decisions include:

- **PTSD** — by far the most common, with unique evidentiary standards
- **Tinnitus** — common in veterans with noise exposure history
- **Hearing loss** — often paired with tinnitus claims
- **Back and knee conditions** — musculoskeletal issues from service
- **Sleep apnea** — frequently claimed as secondary to other conditions

Understanding which conditions dominate BVA dockets can help you anticipate common evidentiary challenges.

### 5. Secondary Condition Claims Are Increasingly Successful

The data shows a trend toward more frequent and more successful secondary condition claims, particularly for mental health conditions secondary to chronic pain conditions. This aligns with the VA's evolving understanding of how conditions interact.

**What this means for your practice:** Always evaluate whether your client's service-connected conditions may have caused or aggravated additional disabilities.

## How CaseScribe Uses This Data

These insights aren't just academic. CaseScribe's AI case strategy engine is informed by analysis of BVA decisions and outcomes. When it identifies opportunities in your cases, it's drawing on patterns from real decisions.

For example:

- When CaseScribe detects a secondary condition opportunity, it's informed by which secondary relationships are most commonly recognized by the BVA
- When it assesses evidence strength, it's calibrated against what the BVA has historically found persuasive
- When it recommends filing strategy, it considers patterns in how the BVA evaluates different types of evidence

## Building Our BVA Decision Explorer

We're building a public BVA Decision Explorer that will let any representative search, filter, and analyze BVA decisions. Filter by condition, outcome, judge, and date range. Find precedents that strengthen your cases.

This is part of our commitment to making the legal knowledge locked inside BVA decisions accessible to every representative — not just firms with the resources to build their own research tools.

The BVA Decision Explorer will be available soon at [casescribe.ai/resources/bva-decisions](/resources/bva-decisions).

## Methodology Note

This analysis is based on publicly available BVA decisions. The patterns described are observational and should inform — not replace — the professional judgment of qualified legal representatives. Every case is unique, and past BVA outcomes do not guarantee future results.
