# Why a 30-Year Law Firm Built Its Own AI

CaseScribe wasn't born in a Silicon Valley incubator. It was built inside a disability law firm that has spent over 30 years helping veterans get the benefits they deserve.

## The Problem We Lived Every Day

After processing tens of thousands of veterans' cases, one thing became crystal clear: **the biggest bottleneck in disability law isn't legal strategy — it's document review.**

A single veteran's C-file can be over 1,000 pages. Medical records from dozens of providers. Service records spanning years. C&P exam reports. Buddy statements. Decision letters. Appeals.

Every page could contain the evidence that makes or breaks a claim. And every page needs to be read, understood, and connected to the bigger picture.

Manual review takes 2-10 hours per case. At scale, that means either:

1. **You hire more reviewers** (expensive, and quality varies)
2. **You process fewer cases** (fewer veterans helped)
3. **You accept that things get missed** (unacceptable)

None of those options were acceptable to us.

## We Tried Everything on the Market

Before building CaseScribe, we evaluated every AI and legal tech tool available. Here's what we found:

- **General document tools** could OCR and sort files, but they didn't understand legal documents
- **Legal-specific tools** could classify documents into basic categories, but couldn't extract meaningful data
- **No tool on the market** could identify secondary conditions, flag 3.156(c) opportunities, or build case strategy

They organized files. They didn't think.

## So We Built Our Own

CaseScribe started as an internal tool — built by people who read C-files every day, for people who read C-files every day.

The key insight was this: **the value isn't in organizing documents. It's in finding the opportunities hidden inside them.**

A secondary condition that connects to a service-connected disability. A rating increase supported by medical evidence the reviewer missed in page 847. A 3.156(c) reopening opportunity because new service records contain evidence for a previously denied claim.

These are the opportunities that change veterans' lives. And they were being missed because no human can reliably spot them across 1,000+ pages.

## What CaseScribe Does Differently

CaseScribe doesn't just organize your files. It:

- **Processes 5,000+ pages in 10 minutes** — OCR, classify, extract, analyze
- **Identifies conditions and evidence** across the entire case file
- **Detects secondary conditions** your team might not have considered
- **Analyzes 3.156(c) opportunities** by comparing old and new service records
- **Recommends filing strategies** based on evidence strength

It's the difference between a filing cabinet and an attorney who has read every page.

## Our Mission

Our mission hasn't changed since day one: **help representatives help more disabled people.**

Every feature we build starts with that question. Will this help a veteran get the benefits they've earned?

If the answer is yes, we build it.
